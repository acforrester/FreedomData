## About

`FreedomData` is a data package that contains measures of economic freedom for 
across countries and the U.S. states from two sources: 

1. Economic Freedom of the World (EFW) 
2. Economic Freedom of North America (EFNA)

To see additional documentation and examples, see [here](docs/index.html).

Eventually the data will be updated to include the Human Freedom Index (HFI).

### Economic Freedom of the World (EFW)

The Economic Freedom of the World (EFW) report is produced by Gwartney et al.
and provides a quantitative index of the quality of countries' economic 
institutions. The index contains the following elements:

| Area      | Description                       |
| :-------- | :-------------------------------- |
| Area 1    | Size of Government                |
| Area 2    | Legal System and Property Rights  |
| Area 3    | Sound Money                       |
| Area 4    | Freedom to Trade Internationally  |
| Area 5    | Regulation                        |
| Gender Legal Rights Adjustment                |

The resulting `EFW` index is an equally weighted average of each area. The index
is only available for countries that have enough data to construct the index in 
each year and is therefore spotty in earlier years. The number of countries in
each year's `EFW` data changes as a result. Be sure to check which countries are
included in your sample before conducting any empirical cross-country comparisons.

### Economic Freedom of North America (EFNA)

The Economic Freedom of North America (EFNA) report from Stansel et al. provides
a quantitative index that measures the quality of economic institutions at the 
subnational level, viz. the U.S. states.  The index is designed to mimic the
cross-country equivalent, the EFW, and is comprised of the following indicators.

| Area      | Description                       |
| :-------- | :-------------------------------- |
| Area 1    | Government Spending               |
| Area 2    | Taxes                             |
| Area 3    | Labor Market Freedom              |

The `EFNA` index itself is an equally weighted average of the three areas.
